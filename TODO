HTML:
  ☐ More attributes
  ☐ More tags
  ☐ Generic way of handling attributes?
  ☐ <address> should ask for rich text as well
  ☐ Better syntax for rich text? (continuations again?)
  ☐ Enrich text to be able to contain <a> for instance
  ☐ Or remove <a> from usual tags
  ☐ Add a lift operator to make a block out of something?
  ☐ Add generic attributes to rich text tags
